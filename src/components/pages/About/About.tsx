          <div className={`text-[#777777] text-[18px] leading-[1.8em] font-normal`}>"I am a contemporary artist focusing on <strong>figurative oil paintings on wood</strong>. My work is inspired by the interplay of <strong>textures, light, and human emotion</strong>, exploring the contrasts of <span>strength and vulnerability</span> through expressive and intimate compositions. <br /><br />

            Using flowing fabrics, rich details, and a balance of bold and delicate brushstrokes, my paintings tell stories that invite viewers to connect with their own emotions and experiences. <br /><br />

            Each piece reflects my passion for <strong>narrative art</strong> and my dedication to creating works that resonate on a personal and universal level. Whether itâ€™s a quiet moment or a bold statement, my art seeks to inspire curiosity and dialogue."</div>
